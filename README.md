# voting-app code

The code in this repository is based on [dockersample voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app).
However, it has been extended to include other modules, such as an alternative worker and a simulator client.

The containers in this project serve as sample applications to showcase containerized environments.
The [voting-app config](https://github.com/ATIX-AG/voting-app-config) project contains the Kubernetes configuration to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster.
